# Creative Routine Bot
A self-contained Github hosted tool to get you doing real work 

Using Github actions and a CSV file, randomly get a generated a routine to work through today!
No SaaS subscription required!

## How does this work?
The CSV file has all your tasks for the day 
Every day at midnight, assuming everything is set up right, you should get a Issue telling you what to warm up with on the day.

## Who is this for 
People who practice things! I use this tool personally to give me a list of excercises to do to across what I read so I practice lots of technqiues when I paint.

## To dos:
1) Serialise the types so I can extend this a bit 
2) Create a mechanism to support a lot of Tasks
2) Add a test or something 
3) Clean up the code
